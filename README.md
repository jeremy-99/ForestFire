# ForestFire
A fast clustering algorithm inspired by the dynamics of forest fires.

Forest Fire Clustering.pdf contains our paper draft, and forest_fire_model.pdf displays the Jupyter Notebook of forest_fire_model.ipynb. The original .ipynb file is unable to display, so I've attached it as a .py file instead.

We evaluated our algorithm on a single-cell dataset of retinal bipolar cells. While the results are visualized and discussed in the pdfs, the dataset was too big to include on Github.
